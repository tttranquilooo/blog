Mr. Daydreamer dreamt of 'homo-sapiens', a database on a server named 'world', being deleted. Everything about processes classified as 'human' , from names to attributes to priority, was stored in it.

The processes panicked, almost overloaded the server for a moment. Soon, found pipes still available, they built up pipe-chain and forgot all about days of databases. 

Such processes worth any server, thought Mr. Daydreamer.
